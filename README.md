# Landing Page

Every good app has a landing page, and this is just that such thing for the Pub Crawl: London iPhone app, which is also [open-source here on GitHub].

## Credits

The landing page uses some code stolen from the wonderful folks at Marvel, from [devices.css](http://marvelapp.github.io/devices.css/) project.
